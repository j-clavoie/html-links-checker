## [1.0.1] - 2020-12-23
Fixed issue with relative links.
The bug was with URL without protocol (http://) and short domain (ex.: "domain.com"). It was considered as a relative URL instead of URL without protocol.
The regex realted to "relative" link has been updated to include file type (html, htm, asp, php, txt).

Added validation of A tag without text (ex.: <a href="domain.name"></a>).
An error is generated if it's occur.


## [1.0.0] - 2020-12-23
Initial version of extension is able to validate:
+ anchor
+ internal link relative from root: start with dash (/) not with ../
